\chapter{Probability Questions}

\section{Easy}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Two coins, one is double tail, you see one \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item three pancakes: golden-golden, golden-brunt, brunt-brunt, see one golden, probability that the other side is golden two
    \item 
   \end{itemize}
 \item Two coins - one toss n+1, one toss n, probability that n+1 gets more tail than n man?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Medium}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use coins to create probabilities : fair coin to create 1/3 probability - toss twice, one result is retoss
unfair coin to create 1/3 probability - combine two toss as one


 \end{enumerate}

Numerical Methods & PDE

1. Stochastic Calculus
  	Infinitesimal generator
		(Lf) x= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{E(f(X_{t + \Delta t| X_t = x} - f(x)}{\Delta t}
  		adjoint opeator L*
				\int (L g1)(x) g_2 (x) dx = \int (L* g2)(x) g_1 (x) dx
	Markov Process and Markov Property
  		
	SDE and PDE
	u(t,x) = E(\phi(X)|X_t = x] 
	\partial_t \Gamma + L\Gamma = 0 (backward)
        \partial_t \Gamma = L* \Gamma(t,x) 
         \Gamma - the density( t,x;T,y)
	\partial_t u + Lu  = 0

        Komoglov  forward and backward equations  - fix t,X ( look at t,y) 
               fix t,Y 


 2. PDE 
    transport equation
    heat equation 


3. Finite Different Method
   
   Taylor Expansion    
  
	Explicit Method      
	Implicit Method
	Crank-Nicholson

   Local Truncation Error 
     Consistency
     Stability 
    COnvergence

Fourier Transformation

数据库
CRSP - stock price and quotes
Compustats - lots of fundemental data 
     B/M
      cash flow to market
       earnings to market price
       five year growth rate of sales 

   Asness measures
	B/M log(BV/MV) 
	D/P = dividend ratio to price

test a strategy

formation period- trading period (rolling) - validation period (separted) OR use a different universe to validate the strategy
hypothesis test will demonstrate whether the strategy gives significant alpha return z

pitfalls in testing quant-strategy

1. Surviorship bias - non-anticipative trading 
2. bid ask spread 
3. transaction cost and liquidity (market impact and liquidity risk) - Almgren and Criss model 

ETF 

Avellaneda and Lee 
   stochastic stock return on ETF model 
physical ETF
synthetic ETF - use derivatives and structured products

“Real World” Statistical Arbitrage / Asset Management

target : sharpe ratio/neutrality to benchmarks

always conduct research on residual space!

“real-world” constraints:  
	budget constrains - financing/borrowing cost
         factor risk vs idiosyncratic single name risk
         transaction cost
         liquidity constraints: market impact/ portfolio turnover

 ** Fundamental Law of Active Management 

      Use the most “top 1000” active stocks
            “attention” vs juice trade-off of stocks 

     Data cleaning
         huge tail 
        erroneous prices can create large outliers
        clean outliers
           winsorization and truncating
           mean absolute devidation 


     Weighting Schemes:
          to account for different residual volatility
          market capitalization and liquidity based weighting scheme / inversely proportional to volatility weights
         
      Visualization is very very important 

      Transaction Cost bid0ask spread, volume participation, stock volatility, alpha: momentum trades will be running away
