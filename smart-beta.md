## Smart Beta History

* In 2005, [RAFI index](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/strategies/rafi/rafi-fundamental-index.html) created
* 2007, "smart beta" created by London Consulting firm Towers Waston
* Aug 2007, Equity Quantitative Strategies had large drawdown, overall exposure down by 75%
* Now, popular factors used include
  * risk premium: value, size
  * behavior anomaly: momentum, value, quality
  * structural impediment: low volatility, strategies in derivatives space\(risk sharing\)

The typical benefit of smart-beta/alternative beta products are diversification \(low correlation\) and low volatility \(1/3 comparing to active equity strategies, 2/3 comparing to active fixed income strategies\)

### Argument about Validity

Grossman-Stiglitz camp argues old ones will stop working, people should continue to develop new ones \(Informationally-inefficient markets\)

Ross-Kahneman-Tversky camp argues traditional ones will continue to work.
