### Factor Timing Methods

#### Pro Factoring Timing/Factor Tilting

* Factor Timing
  * based on time-series or economic regime-based information
  * single assets/strategies or whole portfolio
  * entry/exit signals in medium term
* Factor Tilting
  * cross-sectional factor in factors information
  * portfolio of assets/strategies
  * overweight/underweight signals
  * short/medium term tactical calls
* Andrew Ang
  * tilting based on macroeconomic analysis 
    * economic regime signal \(min vol, quality overweight, size value underweight\)
    * dispersion Signal\(Momentum\)
    * Relative Strength Signal\(Momentum Overwight\)
    * Valuation Signal

Lewellen \(2011\), "Institutional Investors and the Limits of Arbitrage"

18F \(level\) data 1980-2007 shows that institutional investors as a group largely hold the market portfolio, with only minor tilts away trom the market on a dozen major anomalies

Edelen-Ince-Kadlec \(2015\), "Institutional Investors and Stock Return Anomalies"

institutional investors typically are on the wrong side of major anomalies \(except for momentum\) during a 1yr period when the anomaly portiollo was constructed. In particular, institutions often buy apparently overvalued stocks instead of shorting them.

Akbas-Sorescu-Subrahmanyam \(2015\), "Smart Money, Dumb Money, and Cap Mkt Anomalies

Authors Identity hedge funds as smart money and mutual funds as dumb money. They then show that aggregate inflows to mutual funds exacerbate Sectonal mispricings, while hedge fund inflows attenuate them. In both cases, the main impact of inflows is on overvalued stocks.

CalluzzO-Moneta-Topaloglu \(2015\): "Anomalies are Publicized Broadly, Institutions Trade Accordingly, and Returns Decay

Correspondingly", working paper.

More positive results for institutional arbitrage activity than earlier studies. "Higher anomaly-based trading among institutional investors, mainlyhedge funds and "transient institutions \(with high turnover, broad diversification\) is found following the publication of research on anomalies. Higher trading seems in turn to explain the decay in post-publication anomaly returns.

Different results in

Edelen et al. \(2015\) reflect their use of a long window \(&gt;12mo., before ranking\). Calluzzo et al. 

use a much shorter two-quarter window surrounding the anomaly ranking date. Thus, results here highlight the responsive, rather than anticipatory, behavior of institutions wrt. publicly available information
