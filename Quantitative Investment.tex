\subsection{Business Cycle and Debt Cycle}

According to Ray Dailo's Opinion, business cycles are created by credit (borrowing). Growth = Productivity Growth + Debt Cycle Effect.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Total output = Price $\times$ Quantity, while Price = Money + Credit
	\item Long term debt cycle: 75 to 100 years. Short term debt cycle" 5-7 years
	\item Key indicators Inflation, deflation, tax, government spending, unemployment (Government Action)
	\item "Beautify Deleveraging": The phase total debt decreases. Needs: Spending cut, Debt Restructuring, Wealth transfer, Print Money (Government Debt increases, total debt decreases, if not carefully, lead to hyper-inflation
	\item 2-3 years depression/deleveraging and 7-10 yeas "reflation"
\end{itemize}

Keysian Theory 

stagflation and non zero inflation

This chapter summarizes some basic financial concepts you should know about.



\section{Asset Management}

Asset Owners(Real Money): From conservative to active: Banks, Insurance Company, Defined Contribution Plan, Pension, Endowment/Foundations 

Hedge Funds(Fast Money)

Investment Purpose Statement(IPS): Consider Return, Risk, Time Horizon, Tax, Liquidity, Legal and Unique. 

\section{Accounting, Corporate Finance and Fundamental Analysis}

Accounting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash flow Statement Basics
    \item EBIT = operating profit + non recurring expense - non-recurring income, EBITDA, Operating profit, normalized net income = NI + non recurring items
    \item Gross Profit, Operating profit, profit before tax, net income
    \item Gross Margin, EBIT Margin, EBIT Margin, Net Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin 
    \item Cash flow from Operations = NI + DA +- change in inventory/accounts payable, receivable, operating items
    \item CF from investing = Capital Expenditure -+ Disposal/Purchase of Assets
    \item CF from financing = -Dividend - Share buybacks + issuance of stock/bond
    \item Equity: Preferred shares, authorized shares (maximum shares the board can issue), Treasury stock, buy back book value, Free float Market capitalization = share price * ( shares outstanding - shares not traded), Small free float: little share holder control, volatile share price, high premium in M\&A 
\end{itemize}

Capital Structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Operating items vs financing items ( cash, financial asset/liability, equity)
	\item Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities, Operating Working Capital = Operating Assets - Operating Liabilities(exclude cash)
	\item Inventory COGS LIFO FIFO inventory turnover
	\item Payable days, receivable days, working capital cycle (payable days - inventory days + receivable days)
	\item Leverage ratios: Debt/Equity, Total Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA/inst expense	
\end{itemize}

Credit Scoring/Credit Analysis
\begin{itemize}
    \item Credit Risk = Business Risk( Country, Economic Cycle, Industry Cycle, Currencies, Commodities, trends) + Financial Risk(Cash Risk)
    \item Creditor Cashflow Statement Net Income + D/A/non-cash items = FFO( Funds from Operations), FFO +- Decrease/Increase in OWC = Operating Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow - Capex = Free Operating Cash Flow(FOCF)\\ FOCF + Dividends = Discretionary Cash Flow, DCF +- Acquisition, Asset Disposals, Net other sources/uses of cash = pre-financing cashflow +- Increase(Decrease) in Debt, +- Net Sale/Repurchase of Shares = Inc/(Dec) in Cash/Securities
    \item Profitability \& Efficiency Ratios: EBIT/EBITDA margin, Return on Assets, Return on Invested Capital
    \item Coverage Ratios: EBITDA/interest(net interest), EBITDA/(interest + Principal Amortization), EBIT/interest or net interest
    \item Leverage Ratios: Debt/Equity, Debt/Capital, Debt/EBITDA
    \item Cash flow adequacy Ratios: FFO/Debt, FOCF/Debt, Free Cash flow/Debt, Retained Cash Flow/Debt
    \item Liquidity Ratios: maturing debt principal this year/FFO or discretionary cash flow, Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Committed un-used bank credit lines)/maturing debt principal this year.
\end{itemize}

Tax:  Effective Tax Rate, Loss Harvesting and Tax-Aware investment 

Valutaion fundamentals: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intrinsic Value and two approaches - absolute valuation and relative valuation 
	\item Enterprise Value = Debt + Equity Value - Cash/Cash Equivalent = Net Debt Value + Equity Value
	\item Equity Value (affected by performance (operating), investing and financing (leverage)) = Price x Shares Outstanding
	\item Asset = Enterprise Value + Non-core assets(not valued by Multiples/DCF models, like cash)
	\item Free Cash Flow Calculation: EBIT - tax on EBIT (LT tax rate x EBIT) = NOPAT (net operating profit after tax )/EBIAT, Free Cash flow = NOPAT + D\&A - capex - increase in OWC + decrease in OWC - Increase in Other net operating assets + Decrease in other net operating assets -+ change in Long term tax liabilities
	\item FCFF, FCFE 
	\item Discount Rate- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) - CAPM / required rate of return, WACC = D/(D+E) cost of net debt x (1-t) + $(rf+(r_m-r_f)\times beta)\times E/(D+E)$, D is net debt
	\item Gordon Growth Model
	\item EV multipliers : EV/Sales, EV/EBIT，EV/EBITDA
\end{itemize}


Fundamental Analysis, Company Analysis and Value Investing

Management/Strategic Analysis(SWOT, Five forces etc), Industry/Region/ Sector Analysis + competitor Analysis 

\section{ Real-life trading}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shorting a Stock: achieved by a stock-loan process of broker/dealer: broker need to borrow and put colleteral, during borrow agreement, any dividend is passed (synthetically) from the borrower to the beneficial owner. Corporate actions: borrower vote as in lender's proxy. 
    \item SHOrt squeeze: Stock with high short interest trended upwards, short side cover their shorts.
    \item Naked short: short (t+2) before borrow, can borrow/buy later.
    \item Short interest thredhold: 8\% of market cap or free float.
    \item Prime-brokerage: Agency only brokerage does not own books
\end{itemize}

    	\item Lower Bound: Overnight RRP: Non-reserve account holder can earn interest by entering into an overnight reserve repo(overnight RRP)- offer each day.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\part{Quantitative Investment Theories}

\chapter{Quantitative Portfolio Mangement}


\section{Overview and Baseline Theories}

A Basic Quant-trading System needs the following components (maybe from some teams, but need to be integrated)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Benchmark against appropriate total return index
\item Asset Allocation and Portfolio Management	framework
\item Rebalance and account for dynamic risk 
\item Risk tolerance and position sizing quantitatively (Kelly's Criterion)
\item (Optional) Market Regime Filter 
\item Cash Management and Cash-like Instruments Management
\end{enumerate}

Financial Theories involved

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Efficient Market Hypothesis (Weak, Semi-strong, Strong forms)
 \item Markowitz Portfolio Optimization
 \begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum Variance Portfolio / Tangency Portfolio 
    \item Jensen's alpha
  \end{itemize}
  \item Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM) Model \\
        $$ r = \beta(r_m - r_f) + r_f $$
 		$$\beta = \frac{cov(r,r_M)}{var(r_M)}$$
  \item APT(Arbitrage-Free-Pricing) Model 
 \item No-arbitrage(weak, strong) and Law-of-one-price
 \item Metrics
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sharpe Ratio
    \item Jensen's alpha
    
        \item Required Rate of Return = Cost of Capital = Risk-adjusted discount rate : Usually from the CAPM
   \end{itemize}
 \item Valuation using Multiples - P/E, P/B 
 \end{enumerate}
 
 
\section{Portfolio Optimization}

\subsection{Problems}

\begin{itemize}
	\item goal-based approach
        \subitem describing goals, constructing sub-portfolios (selecting a module)
        \subitem Active Holding Optimization - Goal based
	 \item liability-relative
         \subitem surplus optimization
        \subitem hedging/risk-seeking portfolio
         \subitem integrated asset-liability (non-linear correlation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Models}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single Period Models: Mean-variance models, Stochastic Optimization Models
		\subitem  Mixed Integer Optimization
	\item Multi-period Models: Kelly Criterion, Dynamic Portfolio Optimization, Transaction Cost \& Taxes
		\subitem  Stochastic and Dynamic Optimization
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mean-variance model}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Optimization
$$ \min_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{x^TVx} $$
$$ \boldsymbol{ \mu^T x} \geq \bar{\mu}, x \in \chi$$
equivalent to 
$$ \max_{\mathbf{x}} \boldsymbol{ \mu^T x} $$
$$  \mathbf{x^TVx} \leq \bar{\sigma^2}, x \in \chi$$
or
$$ \max_{\mathbf{x}} \boldsymbol{ \mu^T x}  - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{x^TVx} $$
$$ x \in \chi$$

\item Two Fund Theorem

$$ \max_{\mathbf{x}} \boldsymbol{\mu^T x}  - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{x^TVx} $$
$$ \mathbf{1^Tx} = 1$$

Solution 

$$ \mathbf{x^*} = \lambda \frac{1}{\boldsymbol{1^TV^{-1}\mu}}\boldsymbol{V^{-1}\mu} + (1 - \lambda)\frac{1}{\mathbf{1^TV^{-1}1}}\mathbf{V^{-1}1}$$

$$\lambda = \frac{\boldsymbol{1^TV^{-1}\mu}}{\gamma}$$

Notice, 

\tab $\frac{1}{\mathbf{1^TV^{-1}\mu}}\boldsymbol{V^{-1}\mu}$ is the solution of $\min_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{x^TVx}, \mathbf{1^Tx} = 1$

\item One Fund Theorem

Add a risk-free asset into the portfolio

$$ \max_{\mathbf{x}} (\boldsymbol{\mu} - r_f\mathbf{1^T}) \mathbf{x} - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{x^TVx} $$

Solution

$$ \mathbf{x^*} = \lambda \frac{1}{\mathbf{1^TV^{-1}}(\boldsymbol{\mu} - r_f\mathbf{1^T})}\boldsymbol{V^{-1}}(\boldsymbol{\mu} - r_f \mathbf{1^T})$$

$$\lambda = \frac{\mathbf{1^TV^{-1}}(\boldsymbol{\mu} - r_f\mathbf{1^T})}{\gamma}$$

\item Characteristic Portfolio

$$\frac{1}{\boldsymbol{1^TV^{-1}a}}\boldsymbol{V^{-1}a}$$

for attribute $\mathbf{a}$

\item Common Constraints imposed on portfolio optimization would be
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Long-only
		\item Budget Constraint 
		\item Bounds on exposure to sectors
		\item Bounds on individual positions (idiosyncratic risk)
		\item Turnover constraints
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mean-variance short-comings and solutions}

Problems
\begin{itemize}
	\item Markowitz's Curse: Underperformance to market-cap weighted portfolio and concentration on assets.
	\item Estimation of mean and covariance matrix
	\item  allocating to less liquid asset class - (no investable benchmark)
\end{itemize}

Solutions
\begin{itemize}
	\item Monte-Carlo simulation
	\item resampled mean-variance optimization
    \item add additional constriants (other than budget) - concentrated position
    \item resampled mean-variance
    \item  non-normal optimization approach
     \item Covariance matrix shrinkage estimators
      \subitem Stein's Paradox 
      $$\hat{mu} := (1-\omega) \bar{\mathbf{r}} + \omega(\mu_0 \mathbf{1}),\omega \in [0,1]$$
      \subitem Ledoit-Wolf
      $$\hat{\mathbf{V}} := \omega\hat{\mathbf{V}} + (1-\omega)\mathbf{V}_0 ,\omega \in [0,1]$$
      $\mathbf{V}_0$ is prior estimator(constant or single-factor implied cov matrix) 
     \item Black-Litterman Model (Reverse Optimization - Also less sensitive to inputs)
     $$ \mu \sim N(\mathbf{\pi}, \mathbf{Q})$$
     $$ \boldsymbol{P\mu} = q$$ (views)
     $$ \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}} = \E[\boldsymbol{\mu} | views] = \boldsymbol{\pi} + \mathbf{QP^T}(\mathbf{PQP^T})^{-1}(\mathbf{q} - \boldsymbol{P\pi})$$
     By Solving
     $$ \min_{\boldsymbol{\mu}}(\boldsymbol{\mu} - \boldsymbol{\pi})^T \mathbf{Q}^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\mu} - \boldsymbol{\pi}) $$
	$$\boldsymbol{P\mu} = q$$
     $\pi$ is market consensus returns, $\mathbf{Q} = \tau\mathbf{V}$
     \item Robust Estimatiors
     \item  risk budgeting vs factor based asset allocation(risk parity) to maximize diversification
     \subitem Marginal Contribution to Risk $$MRC_i = \frac{\partial \sigma_p}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\boldsymbol{Vx}_i}{\sqrt{\mathbf{x^TVx}}}$$
     \subitem Risk Contribution $$ x_i \dot MRC_i = \frac{x_i \boldsymbol{Vx}_i}{\sqrt{\mathbf{x^TVx}}} = \frac{\sigma_p}{n}$$

\section{Factor Models}

Factor Models plays a key role in all components of asset management

\begin{itemize}
	\item Valuation and Market Expectation: CAPM, APT, alpha signals
	\item Risk Management: Risk attribution, stress test, risk modelling
	\item Portfolio Management: Smart beta, portfolio construction
	\item Performance: Performance attribution, style analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Major Types of Factor Models}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Regression Model: Observable factor returns
	$$ \mathbf{X} =  \mathbf{a} +  \mathbf{BZ} +  \mathbf{U}$$ ,where $\mathbf{Z}$ is observable, estimate $\mathbf{B, a}$($\beta, \alpha$)
	$$(\mathbf{a,B}) = \argmin \E( \norm{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{BZ} - \mathbf{X}}^2)$$
	$$ B = cov(\mathbf{X,Z}) var^{-1} (\mathbf{Z}), a = \E(\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{B}\E(\mathbf{Z}))$$
	Example: CAPM (CAPM beta can be improved by shrinking towards 1
	\item Cross-sectional Model: $\mathbf{B}$ (factor loadings) is observed. Usually use weighted list squares
	$$ \mathbf{X} =  \mathbf{a} +  \mathbf{BZ} +  \mathbf{U}$$ 
	Usually solved with Weighted Least Squares:
	$$(\mathbf{a,Z}) = \argmin \E( \norm{\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{BZ} - \mathbf{X}}^2_{\Delta^{-1}})$$
	$$ Z = (\mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{\Delta}^{-1} \mathbf{B})^{-1} \mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{\Delta}^{-1} \mathbf{X}, a = \E(\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{B}\E(\mathbf{Z}))$$
	$\mathbf{\Delta}$ is often diagonal - associated to preassumed residual sizes.
	Example: most common models, and risk models such as Aximoa and Barra $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{Bf} + \mathbf{u}$, use time series data of r to compute time series data of f
	
	\item Principal Components Model
	$$ \mathbf{X} =  \mathbf{a} +  \mathbf{BZ} +  \mathbf{U}$$
	 $$\mathbf{Z} = [Z_1, Z_2, ..., Z_n]^T$$
	 $$ Z_i = \mathbf{e}_i^T(\mathbf{X} - \E(\mathbf{X})$$
	 $$ \mathbf{e}_i = \argmax _{\mathbf{e}} var(\mathbf{e}^T\mathbf{X})$$
	 $$\norm{\mathbf{e}}^2 = 1$$
	 $$ \mathbf{e}_k^T \mathbf{e} = 0, k = 1,...,i-1$$
	 then 
	 $$\mathbf{V} = var(\mathbf{X}) = [\mathbf{e_1}, \mathbf{e_2},...\mathbf{e_n}]
	 \begin{bmatrix} 
  				 \lambda_1^2 & & \\ 
  				  & \ddots & \\
  				 &  & \lambda_n^2
	\end{bmatrix} [\mathbf{e_1}, \mathbf{e_2},...\mathbf{e_n}]
	 $$
	 Principal Components
	 $$X_i^{PC} = \mathbf{e}_i z_i = \mathbf{e}_i \mathbf{e}_i^ T(\mathbf{X} - \E( \mathbf{X})$$
	 $$\mathbf{B}= [\mathbf{e_1}, \mathbf{e_2},...\mathbf{e_n}], \mathbf{a} = \E( \mathbf{X})$$
	 
	\item Hidden Model: Try to distinguish between systematic and idiosyncratic risk 
	$$ \mathbf{X} =  \mathbf{a} +  \mathbf{BZ} +  \mathbf{U}$$ 
	want $cov(\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{U})$ to be 0 and $var(U) = \Delta$ diagonal,
	want $\mathbf{V} = var(\mathbf{X}) = \mathbf{B}^T var(\mathbf{Z}) \mathbf{B}^T + \mathbf{\Delta}$
	Example: the APT Model
\end{itemize}

\subsection{From a factor portfolio}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Signal portfolio: from factor signals, From a fractile(divide the universe to fractile, form equal weighed portfolios for each fractile) or long-short( long equal weight portfolio with high score, short with low score) (Fama-French's Approach)
	\item Factor Mimicking Portfolios: with only exposure to one of alpha singal/factor attributes $\mathbf{a}$
	$$ \min_{\mathbf{h}}  \mathbf{h}^T  \mathbf{V}  \mathbf{h}$$, $$ \mathbf{a}^T  \mathbf{h} = 1$$
	$$ \mathbf{h} = \frac{1}{ \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{V} \mathbf{a}} \mathbf{V}^{-1}a$$
	in additional, be cash neutral or factor neutral
	$$ \mathbf{1}T\mathbf{h} = 0$$ or $$\mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{h} = 0 $$
\end{itemize}


\section{Alpha}

\begin{itemize}
\item alpha is from signal and based on benchmark/factor models. For example find some signal to score stocks, then compute alpha from z-scores (neutralize for risk factors)
$$\mathbf{\alpha} = \mathbf{z} - (\mathbf{z^T}\mathbf{x}_B) \mathbf{\beta}$$

\item Information Coefficient(IC) : Correlation between factor score/prediction and actual outcome (realized return). IC $\geq$ 0.05 is considered good
\item Grinold and Kahn’s rule of thumb (Alpha scaling)
$$ \alpha = IC \times score \times volatility$$

Usually get covariance from risk model providers (Axioma, Bloomberg, Northfield, Barra)

\item Benchmarkmark-relative mean-variance models 

$$ \min_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{x^TVx} $$
$$ \boldsymbol{ \alpha^T x} \geq \bar{\alpha}, x \in \chi$$
equivalent to 
$$ \max_{\mathbf{x}} \boldsymbol{ \alpha^T x}  - \frac{\gamma}{2} \mathbf{x^TVx} $$
$$ x \in \chi$$

we get $$ \mathbf{x} = \frac{1}{\gamma} \boldsymbol{V^{-1}\alpha}$$

\item Fundamental law of active management
\subitem From above solution $$IR = \sqrt{\alpha^T\boldsymbol{V^{-1}\alpha}}$$
$$\alpha_i = IC \dot \alpha_i \dot z_i, \mathbf{V} = diag(\sigma_1^2, ..., \sigma_N^2)$$
$$IR = \sqrt{\boldsymbol{\alpha^T V^{-1}\alpha}} = IC \sqrt{N} = IC \sqrt{BR}$$
 
 \item The Fundamental Law and Transfer Coefficient
 
$$IR = \frac{\boldsymbol{\alpha^T h}}{\sqrt{\boldsymbol{h^TVh}}} = \frac{\boldsymbol{\alpha^T h}}{\sqrt{\boldsymbol{\alpha^T V^{-1}\alpha}}\sqrt{\boldsymbol{h^TVh}}} \sqrt{\boldsymbol{\alpha^T V^{-1}\alpha}}$$

\chapter{Strategy Development Overview}

Typically, need the sub functions/sub teams including:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Data Curator: Data collection, cleaning, indexing, storing, adjusting and delivering 
 \item Feature Engineering and Analytics: Data Mining, Signal Extraction and Processing using information theory, Data visualization, labeling, filtering, classifiers building - try to extract features
 \item Strategies Research: Make sense of features, market observation, instrument knowledge and try to formulate general theory/intuition that explains market mechanics. Submit code to the backtesting team
 \item Backtesting: Statistical, Stochastic, Econometric tests of strategies/portfolios
 \item Deployment: Rely heavily on computing, process schedulers, automation servers, vectorization, multithreading, multiprocessing, Big Data, Machine Learning on Big Data and High-performance computing 
\end{enumerate}

Back office and Risk Management (See Risk Management chapter)

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Portfolio Aggregation
 \item Portfolio Evaluation
 \item Performance/Risk Attribution
\end{enumerate}

Also, teams should also maintain and select current strategies, typically, a strategy experiences Embargo, Paper Trading, Real-money trading, Re-allocation and Decommission.

Some Major Challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Traditional Portfolio Mangers work in silos and make decisions alone. While quant investing need to cut-down the decision making process to small research projects and run as a strategy factor
 \item Combine "black-box" PM views/market intuition with quant research results from data/math. 
 \item Combine machine learning algorithm with existing traditional strategies. 	
 \item "Backtest overfitting": Without limitation on number of trials, Sharpe ratio in back test could be very high. 
\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Financial Data Modeling}

\section{Financial Data Structure}

Basic Assumptions: Most time should check implicit assumptions

\begin{itemize}
\item Equities $log(\frac{V_{t+1}}{V_t}$ i.i.d. Liquidity varies a lot. Benchmark indices can be misleading: eg. DJIA is priced-weighted. S\&P 500 leans towards large market cap companies and not include \textbf{dividend reinvestment} (S\&P Total Return Index include)
\item Fixed Income $Y_t(\tau) = -\frac{1}{\tau} log(V_t(t+\tau))$ i.i.d shock on interest rate (bond yield)
\item Risk drivers/factors $\mathbf{X}_t = [X_{1,t}...X_{\bar{d},t}]$ homogeneous in time, and determines the joint PnL of instruments

\end{itemize}

Data Problems
\begin{itemize}
 \item return measured less than a year includes implicit extrapolation
 \item illiquid and infrequent priced assets may be priced with
 	\subitem Matrix pricing (common in bond market)
 	\subitem Consensus/Expert Data
 \item Bonds: Recall, Termination (Aging), Exchanged
 \item Stock: Corporate Actions (Splits, Reverse Splits, Voting Rights, etc)
 \item Futures and Options: Termination and Rolling
 \item Currencies: Not Traded in centralized order book 
\end{itemize}

Signals

\begin{itemize}
 \item Quote Offers canceling/replacing with sell orders 0 potnetial sell off information
 \item Limit Orders vs Market Orders 
\end{itemize}

Historical Data is a singleton. All Market Data (eg. a candle stick ) should be organized to feed the researcher to program strategies on the backtester (eg. like quantopian). All back-testing should be parallized (ideally on GPU) to display parameter-profit relationship. (heatmap, stock charts, etc ) Ideally the optimization process could be visualized (like Tensorflow) 

All like a research facility feedback cycle. 

Key Details: API Design, Module Separation etc. 
\subsection{Data}

Key is a real-time listener. Technical Considerations: KDB, Hadoop and HDFI(?), SQL Like, Mongo Db to store Archive Data. Market Data Providers consideration buying from Wind, BBG, Reuters, Etc. \\

*Send Singal to Quoting/Trading/Exection Tool(Real Time)
*Market Data Objects (eg. loop for every time bins)
*stop loss/risk control system integration
*parameter-backtest profit/statistics result: optimization and loss function set function to tune the parameters
*multi-thread: Java backter (Java thread pool*)
*human selection of parameters: parameter table and visualization

\subsection{Trade Record and Money Management}

\subsection{Analytics}

\subsubsection{ Strategy Management }, Sharpe Anslysis, Holding Period, Slippage visualization to better assistant strategic allocation

\subsubsection{Execution Analysis and Cost}

quantitative trading/systematic trading strategies:
* equity long/short

\subsection{Research Team}
Key problems:
* Optimization and Combination of Sub-Strategies (Eg. factors)
* Market Regime Change Detection(problem not solved): Distinguish between trend and oscillation market
* market supply/demand imbalance analysis (risk-premia) 
* volatility trading, dispersion trading - 2nd and 3rd degree trading, (vol model, vol clustering effect, vol leverage effect)
* hedging/overlay strategy research: hedging cost and hedging risk management, how to adjust hedge according to market condition.
* common ideas: market imbalance, mean-reversion, autocorrelation patterns etc (find patterns and trade) - based on statistics.  Risk factors, implied arbitrage - based on math. 

\subsubsection{Parameter Optmization and Control}

Rely on GUI - parameter distribution and selection
optmization methdologies from machine learning ( see optimization chapter)
robustness anslysis and out-of sample test ** ( random cut the universe of rolling window on selection period )

\subsubsection{Signal Indicator Design}

For example, based on fundemental ratio and technical indicators - design a formula. And check the level of prediction power (if any)

1.seeking stationarity: find a stationary time series
	use difference, integration, and normalize with volatility 
2.find signal level, plot cumulative back-test return against different signal level (use own quotes, and use signal level to filter quotes)
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{7.JPG}
3.Check stability of customized indicators 
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{8.JPG}
4. check overfitting and type-II error in all settings, apply noise filtering if possible 
5. design a interface to input indicator(math formula parser to read string) and visualize information using GUI.(HTML/XML Render)
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{9.JPG}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{10.JPG}
6. aggregate all indicators( eg. macd, ead ). Aggregate all strategies using optimization framework or selection framework to gain statistical alpha
7. indicator effectiveness test
1. test correlation - the correlation between indicator and profit vs. the correlation between correlation and white noise(hypothesis test) * use spearman correlation rather than pearson correlation* 
2. Use Monte Carlo Simulation to do permutation test of effectiveness of indicator
3. Very very hard - detect sensentivity to market regime change(osicallation and trend) and identify market regime change. 

\subsubsection{Integration of single indicators and portfolio theory}

Form indicator as factors: standardization to mean-0, normal/t-distributed scores. Select powerful ones (ones that passed the permutation test). Optimize to maximize holdings exposure to factor with risk penalty. The key is still feature engineering.

\section{Performance Analysis}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Performance Measurement
 \subitem Measure returns: Time-weighted(TWRR) or money-weighted (MWRR)
 \item Performance Attribution
 \subitem Key is benchmark
 \item Performance Appraisal 
 \subitem Different Performance Measures
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Performance Attribution and Style Analysis} 

Key to do performance attribution and portfolio risk management is the selection of benchmarks (ideally liquid, investable, and reflects style). Common ones like indices, manager's universe, factor model or customized benchmark can be tested by

\begin{itemize}
 \item Minimal systematic bias: (historical beta of portfolio of benchmark should be close to 1, correlation between P-B and B-M should be zero
 \item Tracking Error should be minimal
 \item Exposure to systematic risks should be similar to the portfolio
 \item Coverage (percent of market value of portfolio) should be maximal
 \item Turn over should not be excessive
 \item Active positions should be measurable and positive
 \end{itemize} 

Performance Attribution

\begin{itemize}	

 \item Macro Performance Attribution : From fund sponsor's perspective. 
 	\subitem Usually from asset class perspective: Policy Allocation + benchmark asset return + fund returns, variations, cash flows
 \item Micro Performance Attribution: To stock/asset level or to factor level (see: style analysis).
 e.g.
 $$r_v = \sum_j(w_{Pj} - w_{Bj})(r_{Bj}- r_B) + \sum _j(w_{Pj} - w_{Bj})(r_{Pj} - r_{Bj}) + \sum_j w_B (r_{Pj} - r_{Bj}) $$
 \item Style Analysis
 	$$r_p(t) = \sum w_i f_i(t) + u_p(t)$$
 	Solve quadratic optimization
 	$$\argmin var(u_p(t))$$
 	$$w_i \geq 0, \sum w_i = 1$$
 	(notice, not minimize squared error, use $t-T$ period to estimate $w_i$, then get the selection return(specific risk) \\
  \item Variations include
  
    \begin{itemize}
  	\item weight change over time, the will cause the solution to be undetermined, need to discourage large movements by regularization. 
  	\item factors usage: 
  	\subitem  fundamental factor model 
  		\subsubitem sector factor: from return to get exposure
  		\subsubitem style factor: from exposure (factor loading/factor scores) to get return. (See Factor Models)
  	\subitem macroeconomic factor models(economic factors as GDP, rates)
  	\subitem statistical factor models(PCA, Asymptotic PCAs and time varying factors) 
  \end{itemize} 
  
  \item Then decompose the risk with factors: the risk of k-th exposure weighted factor: $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{l=1}^T (w_k f_k(l) - \overline{w_k f_k})^2}$$
  \item Bond portfolio performance Attribution: Same spirit but more complicated than equity portfolio: Need to separate 
  	\subitem External Interest Rate Enviroment
  	  	\subsubitem returns on default free bonds with no forward rate change
  		\subsubitem return due to the change of forward curves
  	\subitem Management Process
  		\subsubitem Interest Rate Management Effect: treat as if default free bonds
  		\subsubitem Sector Quality Effect: sector and quality group
  		\subsubitem Security Selection: within group selection
  		\subsubitem Trading Activity: residual
\end{itemize}


  
\subsection{Measure Performance}

The key purpose is to collect data and do statistical tests on alpha. 

Common Performance Measures

\begin{itemize}
 \item Jensen's Alpha (expost $E(r_p) - E(r_b)$
 $$ r_p(t) = \alpha_p + \beta_P r_B(t) + \epsilon_p(t) $$
 t-test on $\frac{\alpha_P}{SE_{\alpha_p}}$ usually use 2 as a thredhold \\
 Rule of Thumb:
 $$IR = \frac{t-stat}{\sqrt{T}}$$
 Can be used with a single benchmark, sector or style multi-factor models
 \item Ratio Measures
	\subitem Total Risk: Sharpe, M2 Measure
	\subitem Systematic Risk: Treynor Ratio
	\subitem Information Ratio: $$ \frac{r_A - r_B}{\sigma_{A/B}}$$
\end{itemize}
