This chapter summarizes some basic financial concepts you should know about.



\section{Asset Management}

Asset Owners(Real Money): From conservative to active: Banks, Insurance Company, Defined Contribution Plan, Pension, Endowment/Foundations 

Hedge Funds(Fast Money)

Investment Purpose Statement(IPS): Consider Return, Risk, Time Horizon, Tax, Liquidity, Legal and Unique. 

\section{Accounting, Corporate Finance and Fundamental Analysis}

Accounting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash flow Statement Basics
    \item EBIT = operating profit + non recurring expense - non-recurring income, EBITDA, Operating profit, normalized net income = NI + non recurring items
    \item Gross Profit, Operating profit, profit before tax, net income
    \item Gross Margin, EBIT Margin, EBIT Margin, Net Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin 
    \item Cash flow from Operations = NI + DA +- change in inventory/accounts payable, receivable, operating items
    \item CF from investing = Capital Expenditure -+ Disposal/Purchase of Assets
    \item CF from financing = -Dividend - Share buybacks + issuance of stock/bond
    \item Equity: Preferred shares, authorized shares (maximum shares the board can issue), Treasury stock, buy back book value, Free float Market capitalization = share price * ( shares outstanding - shares not traded), Small free float: little share holder control, volatile share price, high premium in M\&A 
\end{itemize}

Capital Structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Operating items vs financing items ( cash, financial asset/liability, equity)
	\item Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities, Operating Working Capital = Operating Assets - Operating Liabilities(exclude cash)
	\item Inventory COGS LIFO FIFO inventory turnover
	\item Payable days, receivable days, working capital cycle (payable days - inventory days + receivable days)
	\item Leverage ratios: Debt/Equity, Total Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA/inst expense	
\end{itemize}

Credit Scoring/Credit Analysis
\begin{itemize}
    \item Credit Risk = Business Risk( Country, Economic Cycle, Industry Cycle, Currencies, Commodities, trends) + Financial Risk(Cash Risk)
    \item Creditor Cashflow Statement Net Income + D/A/non-cash items = FFO( Funds from Operations), FFO +- Decrease/Increase in OWC = Operating Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow - Capex = Free Operating Cash Flow(FOCF)\\ FOCF + Dividends = Discretionary Cash Flow, DCF +- Acquisition, Asset Disposals, Net other sources/uses of cash = pre-financing cashflow +- Increase(Decrease) in Debt, +- Net Sale/Repurchase of Shares = Inc/(Dec) in Cash/Securities
    \item Profitability \& Efficiency Ratios: EBIT/EBITDA margin, Return on Assets, Return on Invested Capital
    \item Coverage Ratios: EBITDA/interest(net interest), EBITDA/(interest + Principal Amortization), EBIT/interest or net interest
    \item Leverage Ratios: Debt/Equity, Debt/Capital, Debt/EBITDA
    \item Cash flow adequacy Ratios: FFO/Debt, FOCF/Debt, Free Cash flow/Debt, Retained Cash Flow/Debt
    \item Liquidity Ratios: maturing debt principal this year/FFO or discretionary cash flow, Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Committed un-used bank credit lines)/maturing debt principal this year.
\end{itemize}

Tax:  Effective Tax Rate, Loss Harvesting and Tax-Aware investment 

Valutaion fundamentals: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intrinsic Value and two approaches - absolute valuation and relative valuation 
	\item Enterprise Value = Debt + Equity Value - Cash/Cash Equivalent = Net Debt Value + Equity Value
	\item Equity Value (affected by performance (operating), investing and financing (leverage)) = Price x Shares Outstanding
	\item Asset = Enterprise Value + Non-core assets(not valued by Multiples/DCF models, like cash)
	\item Free Cash Flow Calculation: EBIT - tax on EBIT (LT tax rate x EBIT) = NOPAT (net operating profit after tax )/EBIAT, Free Cash flow = NOPAT + D\&A - capex - increase in OWC + decrease in OWC - Increase in Other net operating assets + Decrease in other net operating assets -+ change in Long term tax liabilities
	\item FCFF, FCFE 
	\item Discount Rate- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) - CAPM / required rate of return, WACC = D/(D+E) cost of net debt x (1-t) + $(rf+(r_m-r_f)\times beta)\times E/(D+E)$, D is net debt
	\item Gordon Growth Model
	\item EV multipliers : EV/Sales, EV/EBIT，EV/EBITDA
\end{itemize}

Historical Data is a singleton. All Market Data (eg. a candle stick ) should be organized to feed the researcher to program strategies on the backtester (eg. like quantopian). All back-testing should be parallized (ideally on GPU) to display parameter-profit relationship. (heatmap, stock charts, etc ) Ideally the optimization process could be visualized (like Tensorflow) 

All like a research facility feedback cycle. 

Key Details: API Design, Module Separation etc. 
\subsection{Data}

Key is a real-time listener. Technical Considerations: KDB, Hadoop and HDFI(?), SQL Like, Mongo Db to store Archive Data. Market Data Providers consideration buying from Wind, BBG, Reuters, Etc. \\

teams: platform operation engineer, analytics builder, strategy control/management and risk management, data team, execution team, researcher team ( 3 x tech )\\

data licensing and data quality insurance \\

data base, text file archive, big data issue\\

cheap data: brokerage: interative brokers.

\subsection{Backtester/Simulator}

Key Components

*Send Singal to Quoting/Trading/Exection Tool(Real Time)
*Market Data Objects (eg. loop for every time bins)
*stop loss/risk control system integration
*parameter-backtest profit/statistics result: optimization and loss function set function to tune the parameters
*multi-thread: Java backter (Java thread pool*)
*human selection of parameters: parameter table and visualization

\subsection{Trade Record and Money Management}

record every trade, summarize execution shortfall, statistical trends and information (shortcomings of strategy executions) and market information ( learning material) build statistics and storage

More: order book and trade book level data handling

\subsection{Analytics}

\subsubsection{ Strategy Management }, Sharpe Anslysis, Holding Period, Slippage visualization to better assistant strategic allocation

\subsubsection{Execution Analysis and Cost}

quantitative trading/systematic trading strategies:
* equity long/short

\subsection{Research Team}
Key problems:
* Optimization and Combination of Sub-Strategies (Eg. factors)
* Market Regime Change Detection(problem not solved): Distinguish between trend and oscillation market
* market supply/demand imbalance analysis (risk-premia) 
* volatility trading, dispersion trading - 2nd and 3rd degree trading, (vol model, vol clustering effect, vol leverage effect)
* hedging/overlay strategy research: hedging cost and hedging risk management, how to adjust hedge according to market condition.
* common ideas: market imbalance, mean-reversion, autocorrelation patterns etc (find patterns and trade) - based on statistics.  Risk factors, implied arbitrage - based on math. 

\subsubsection{Parameter Optmization and Control}

Rely on GUI - parameter distribution and selection
optmization methdologies from machine learning ( see optimization chapter)
robustness anslysis and out-of sample test ** ( random cut the universe of rolling window on selection period )

\subsubsection{Signal Indicator Design}

For example, based on fundemental ratio and technical indicators - design a formula. And check the level of prediction power (if any)

1.seeking stationarity: find a stationary time series
	use difference, integration, and normalize with volatility 
2.find signal level, plot cumulative back-test return against different signal level (use own quotes, and use signal level to filter quotes)
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{7.JPG}
3.Check stability of customized indicators 
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{8.JPG}
4. check overfitting and type-II error in all settings, apply noise filtering if possible 
5. design a interface to input indicator(math formula parser to read string) and visualize information using GUI.(HTML/XML Render)
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{9.JPG}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{10.JPG}
6. aggregate all indicators( eg. macd, ead ). Aggregate all strategies using optimization framework or selection framework to gain statistical alpha
7. indicator effectiveness test
1. test correlation - the correlation between indicator and profit vs. the correlation between correlation and white noise(hypothesis test) * use spearman correlation rather than pearson correlation* 
2. Use Monte Carlo Simulation to do permutation test of effectiveness of indicator
3. Very very hard - detect sensentivity to market regime change(osicallation and trend) and identify market regime change. 

\subsubsection{Integration of single indicators and portfolio theory}

Form indicator as factors: standardization to mean-0, normal/t-distributed scores. Select powerful ones (ones that passed the permutation test). Optimize to maximize holdings exposure to factor with risk penalty. The key is still feature engineering.

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{11.JPG}

For Covariance, See section "covariance matrix".  



\subsubsection{Strategy Risk Management and Money management}

small stop loss, big stop gain level on reversion strategies.bigger stop loss, smaller stop gains on volatile markets - based on experience, market analysis.

Choose symmeteric/non-symmetric risk control based on market belief
