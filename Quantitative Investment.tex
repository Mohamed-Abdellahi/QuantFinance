\subsection{Business Cycle and Debt Cycle}

According to Ray Dailo's Opinion, business cycles are created by credit (borrowing). Growth = Productivity Growth + Debt Cycle Effect.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Total output = Price $\times$ Quantity, while Price = Money + Credit
	\item Long term debt cycle: 75 to 100 years. Short term debt cycle" 5-7 years
	\item Key indicators Inflation, deflation, tax, government spending, unemployment (Government Action)
	\item "Beautify Deleveraging": The phase total debt decreases. Needs: Spending cut, Debt Restructuring, Wealth transfer, Print Money (Government Debt increases, total debt decreases, if not carefully, lead to hyper-inflation
	\item 2-3 years depression/deleveraging and 7-10 yeas "reflation"
\end{itemize}

stagflation and non zero inflation




\chapter{Basic Financial Concepts}                % Print a "chapter" heading

This chapter summarizes some basic financial concepts you should know about.



\section{Asset Management}

Asset Owners(Real Money): From conservative to active: Banks, Insurance Company, Defined Contribution Plan, Pension, Endowment/Foundations 

Hedge Funds(Fast Money)

Investment Purpose Statement(IPS): Consider Return, Risk, Time Horizon, Tax, Liquidity, Legal and Unique. 

\section{Accounting, Corporate Finance and Fundamental Analysis}

Accounting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash flow Statement Basics
    \item EBIT = operating profit + non recurring expense - non-recurring income, EBITDA, Operating profit, normalized net income = NI + non recurring items
    \item Gross Profit, Operating profit, profit before tax, net income
    \item Gross Margin, EBIT Margin, EBIT Margin, Net Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin 
    \item Cash flow from Operations = NI + DA +- change in inventory/accounts payable, receivable, operating items
    \item CF from investing = Capital Expenditure -+ Disposal/Purchase of Assets
    \item CF from financing = -Dividend - Share buybacks + issuance of stock/bond
    \item Equity: Preferred shares, authorized shares (maximum shares the board can issue), Treasury stock, buy back book value, Free float Market capitalization = share price * ( shares outstanding - shares not traded), Small free float: little share holder control, volatile share price, high premium in M\&A 
\end{itemize}

Capital Structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Operating items vs financing items ( cash, financial asset/liability, equity)
	\item Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities, Operating Working Capital = Operating Assets - Operating Liabilities(exclude cash)
	\item Inventory COGS LIFO FIFO inventory turnover
	\item Payable days, receivable days, working capital cycle (payable days - inventory days + receivable days)
	\item Leverage ratios: Debt/Equity, Total Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA/inst expense	
\end{itemize}

Credit Scoring/Credit Analysis
\begin{itemize}
    \item Credit Risk = Business Risk( Country, Economic Cycle, Industry Cycle, Currencies, Commodities, trends) + Financial Risk(Cash Risk)
    \item Creditor Cashflow Statement Net Income + D/A/non-cash items = FFO( Funds from Operations), FFO +- Decrease/Increase in OWC = Operating Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow - Capex = Free Operating Cash Flow(FOCF)\\ FOCF + Dividends = Discretionary Cash Flow, DCF +- Acquisition, Asset Disposals, Net other sources/uses of cash = pre-financing cashflow +- Increase(Decrease) in Debt, +- Net Sale/Repurchase of Shares = Inc/(Dec) in Cash/Securities
    \item Profitability \& Efficiency Ratios: EBIT/EBITDA margin, Return on Assets, Return on Invested Capital
    \item Coverage Ratios: EBITDA/interest(net interest), EBITDA/(interest + Principal Amortization), EBIT/interest or net interest
    \item Leverage Ratios: Debt/Equity, Debt/Capital, Debt/EBITDA
    \item Cash flow adequacy Ratios: FFO/Debt, FOCF/Debt, Free Cash flow/Debt, Retained Cash Flow/Debt
    \item Liquidity Ratios: maturing debt principal this year/FFO or discretionary cash flow, Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Committed un-used bank credit lines)/maturing debt principal this year.
\end{itemize}

Tax:  Effective Tax Rate, Loss Harvesting and Tax-Aware investment 

Valutaion fundamentals: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intrinsic Value and two approaches - absolute valuation and relative valuation 
	\item Enterprise Value = Debt + Equity Value - Cash/Cash Equivalent = Net Debt Value + Equity Value
	\item Equity Value (affected by performance (operating), investing and financing (leverage)) = Price x Shares Outstanding
	\item Asset = Enterprise Value + Non-core assets(not valued by Multiples/DCF models, like cash)
	\item Free Cash Flow Calculation: EBIT - tax on EBIT (LT tax rate x EBIT) = NOPAT (net operating profit after tax )/EBIAT, Free Cash flow = NOPAT + D\&A - capex - increase in OWC + decrease in OWC - Increase in Other net operating assets + Decrease in other net operating assets -+ change in Long term tax liabilities
	\item FCFF, FCFE 
	\item Discount Rate- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) - CAPM / required rate of return, WACC = D/(D+E) cost of net debt x (1-t) + $(rf+(r_m-r_f)\times beta)\times E/(D+E)$, D is net debt
	\item Gordon Growth Model
	\item EV multipliers : EV/Sales, EV/EBIT，EV/EBITDA
\end{itemize}


Fundamental Analysis, Company Analysis and Value Investing

Management/Strategic Analysis(SWOT, Five forces etc), Industry/Region/ Sector Analysis + competitor Analysis 

\section{ Real-life trading}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shorting a Stock: achieved by a stock-loan process of broker/dealer: broker need to borrow and put colleteral, during borrow agreement, any dividend is passed (synthetically) from the borrower to the beneficial owner. Corporate actions: borrower vote as in lender's proxy. 
    \item SHOrt squeeze: Stock with high short interest trended upwards, short side cover their shorts.
    \item Naked short: short (t+2) before borrow, can borrow/buy later.
    \item Short interest thredhold: 8\% of market cap or free float.
    \item Prime-brokerage: Agency only brokerage does not own books
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Major Asset Classes and Asset Valuation Theories}

    \item Fed Funds Rate: 
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item The Upper Bound: Interest on Excess Reserves: interest rate paid by the Fed on Excess reserves held by banks at the Fed. (many money market participants are not reserve account holders so they do not have access to the IOER). 
    	\item Lower Bound: Overnight RRP: Non-reserve account holder can earn interest by entering into an overnight reserve repo(overnight RRP)- offer each day.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

value, momementum, quality, volatility, betaRM-RF  The return spread between the capitalization weighted stock market and cash.

QUality Minus Junk (quanlity)

SMB      The return spread of small minus large stocks (i.e., the size effect).

HML      The return spread of cheap minus expensive stocks (i.e., the value effect).

RMW     The return spread of the most profitable firms minus the least profitable.

\chapter{Strategy Development Overview}

Typically, need the sub functions/sub teams including:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Data Curator: Data collection, cleaning, indexing, storing, adjusting and delivering 
 \item Feature Engineering and Analytics: Data Mining, Signal Extraction and Processing using information theory, Data visualization, labeling, filtering, classifiers building - try to extract features
 \item Strategies Research: Make sense of features, market observation, instrument knowledge and try to formulate general theory/intuition that explains market mechanics. Submit code to the backtesting team
 \item Backtesting: Statistical, Stochastic, Econometric tests of strategies/portfolios
 \item Deployment: Rely heavily on computing, process schedulers, automation servers, vectorization, multithreading, multiprocessing, Big Data, Machine Learning on Big Data and High-performance computing 
\end{enumerate}

Also, teams should also maintain and select current strategies, typically, a strategy experiences Embargo, Paper Trading, Real-money trading, Re-allocation and Decommission.

Some Major Challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Traditional Portfolio Mangers work in silos and make decisions alone. While quant investing need to cut-down the decision making process to small research projects and run as a strategy factor
 \item Combine "black-box" PM views/market intuition with quant research results from data/math. 
 \item Combine machine learning algorithm with existing traditional strategies. 	
 \item "Backtest overfitting": Without limitation on number of trials, Sharpe ratio in back test could be very high.

Historical Data is a singleton. All Market Data (eg. a candle stick ) should be organized to feed the researcher to program strategies on the backtester (eg. like quantopian). All back-testing should be parallized (ideally on GPU) to display parameter-profit relationship. (heatmap, stock charts, etc ) Ideally the optimization process could be visualized (like Tensorflow) 

All like a research facility feedback cycle. 

Key Details: API Design, Module Separation etc. 
\subsection{Data}

\subsubsection{Execution Analysis and Cost}

quantitative trading/systematic trading strategies:
* equity long/short

\subsection{Research Team}
Key problems:
* Optimization and Combination of Sub-Strategies (Eg. factors)
* Market Regime Change Detection(problem not solved): Distinguish between trend and oscillation market
* market supply/demand imbalance analysis (risk-premia) 
* volatility trading, dispersion trading - 2nd and 3rd degree trading, (vol model, vol clustering effect, vol leverage effect)
* hedging/overlay strategy research: hedging cost and hedging risk management, how to adjust hedge according to market condition.
* common ideas: market imbalance, mean-reversion, autocorrelation patterns etc (find patterns and trade) - based on statistics.  Risk factors, implied arbitrage - based on math. 

\subsubsection{Parameter Optmization and Control}

Rely on GUI - parameter distribution and selection
optmization methdologies from machine learning ( see optimization chapter)
robustness anslysis and out-of sample test ** ( random cut the universe of rolling window on selection period )

\subsubsection{Signal Indicator Design}

For example, based on fundemental ratio and technical indicators - design a formula. And check the level of prediction power (if any)

1.seeking stationarity: find a stationary time series
	use difference, integration, and normalize with volatility 
2.find signal level, plot cumulative back-test return against different signal level (use own quotes, and use signal level to filter quotes)

3.Check stability of customized indicators 
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{8.JPG}
4. check overfitting and type-II error in all settings, apply noise filtering if possible 
5. design a interface to input indicator(math formula parser to read string) and visualize information using GUI.(HTML/XML Render)
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{9.JPG}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{10.JPG}
6. aggregate all indicators( eg. macd, ead ). Aggregate all strategies using optimization framework or selection framework to gain statistical alpha
7. indicator effectiveness test
1. test correlation - the correlation between indicator and profit vs. the correlation between correlation and white noise(hypothesis test) * use spearman correlation rather than pearson correlation* 
2. Use Monte Carlo Simulation to do permutation test of effectiveness of indicator
3. Very very hard - detect sensentivity to market regime change(osicallation and trend) and identify market regime change. 

\subsubsection{Integration of single indicators and portfolio theory}

Form indicator as factors: standardization to mean-0, normal/t-distributed scores. Select powerful ones (ones that passed the permutation test). Optimize to maximize holdings exposure to factor with risk penalty. The key is still feature engineering.

\subsubsection{Strategy Risk Management and Money management}

small stop loss, big stop gain level on reversion strategies.bigger stop loss, smaller stop gains on volatile markets - based on experience, market analysis.

Sell Side Risk

Coherent  Risk measure

monotonicity

subadditivity

positive homogeneity

translation invariance



liquidity risk


funding liduitdity
market liquidity ( brokerage fees, execution price compared to mid-point, impact of transaction in the market price, the speed of transaction execution)


evidence that liquidity good: stable quoted bid-ask spread, order book depth deep, falling realized bid-ask spread, 
evidence for bad liquidity: large trades have more market impact, average trade size fall, increased bifurcation in the corporate bond market( different liquidity preferring on-the-run)


influncers

regulators( e.g. leverage, Volker Rule)

Central bank
  bank funding channel
  market functioning channel
 risk appetite channel

liquidity measures
bid-ask spread
effective spread
Roll’s price reversal 
Corwin and Schultz high-low spread 
price impact
turnover
Amihud’s measure
Markit’s liquidity score
Dealer count
Quote depth
Imputed round-trip cost






tightness: cost of a round-trip transaction
market depth: how much moved by a large order
resiliency : length of time for which a lumpy order moves the market away from the equilibrium price
adverse price impact
slippage( the amount of deterioration in the market price induced by the amount of time it takes to get a trade done)

model replication
benchmarking and hypothetical portfolio testing (with another strategy)
